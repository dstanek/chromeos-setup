# README.md

This repo contains the things I use to setup my Lenovo Duet Chromebook. I'm doing
this so that I have an easy way to ensure I always have the same setup. This is only
for the Linux(Beta) support right now.

I'm not sure if there is a way to deal with the other things I've changed like the
touchpad scolling direction or the swapping of the control/search keys.

Command used to get this all setup:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dstanek/chromeos-setup/master/bootstrap.sh)
```
